I am research software specialist at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at the Mellon College of Science since June 2020. At the moment I am involved with [HuBMAP](https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap) and the [Brain Image Library](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/).

I am also a senior research programmer at the Computational Biology Department at the School of Computer Science.
