This flashcards set was created for the attendees of the [Pittsburgh Spanish Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Spanish/events/264262917/) and the [Spanish II](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/?s=spanish+ii&search-location=Website) experience at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

I remember when this song came out. Pity, back then I used to think there was a chance to go back to the home country.

"I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay..."
