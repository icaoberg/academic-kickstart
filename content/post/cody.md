[Mathworks Cody](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/) is a platform for having fun with Matlab. I mean I am having fun. I think it is similar to LeetCode or HackerRank. Main difference is, it is meant for Matlab.

Some of these exercises are simple -so far-. I like these kind of sites because it keep my old brain active.
