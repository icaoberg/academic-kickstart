Next Saturday, I will host [small conversation groups](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Spanish/events/267056429/) at the Lawrenceville Branch of the Carnegie Library.

These meetings are meant for intermediate to advanced members. Beginners are welcome, but it will be difficult to have a separate group if few members show up.
