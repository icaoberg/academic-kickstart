## Comment
In the song the author uses the expression *pajas del intelecto*. These comes from the expression "paja mental". Even though there is a long explanation to using this phrase in rican culture, let's just say its interpretation can be "ideas/thoughts that lead nowhere" or "ideas/thoughts that are not productive".
