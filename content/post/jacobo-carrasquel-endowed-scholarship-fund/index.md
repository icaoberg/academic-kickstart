# About the Fund

**From the official website**

The Jacobo Carrasquel Endowed Scholarship Fund has been created in honor of CMU alumnus and teaching professor emeritus Jacobo Carrasquel (S'83, HNZ'88), who retired from CMU in September 2019, after 38 years at the university. Jacobo has always believed in the strength that comes from diversity, and so this need-based scholarship will honor Jacoboâ€™s legacy by supporting an SCS student who will follow in his trailblazing footsteps, making our community stronger as a result.

Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, Jacobo joined CMU as a student in the fall of 1980. He joined the SCS faculty in the fall of 1983. During the last 39 years he taught courses for CS majors and students from all seven colleges. In 2004, he went to Qatar to start the CMU campus in Doha. Upon his return to Pittsburgh in 2006, he became the SCS Freshman Academic Advisor. Jacobo retired this past August and the university granted him with Emeritus status for his many contributions to the CMU community.

# Why donate?

**The following words are mine, this is my opinion as an alumn and staff**

This fund will be the first of its kind at the School of Computer Science!

Even though CMU offers financial aid and has access to funds that may help underrepresented minorities, this will be the first fund aimed at providing help to prospective Latinx students wanting to pursue a degree in the School of Computer Science.

This is very important for many reasons

* when an alum donates to the general fund there is no guarantee the funds will be used to aid members of our community.
* when an alum donates to a particular fund, then the funds will benefit the members/causes described in that endowment.  It was not until now that we had a fund that would help prospective students from our community.
* there many talented prospective students who have the potential to come to Carnegie Mellon, however many cannot afford tuition or the limited aid provided by the University is still a financial burden.

Now, notice that I said *this fund will be* the first of its kind. In order to establish the endowment, we will need to raise an initial amount of $50K dollars. The last day to donate and reach the goal is June 31, 2020.
