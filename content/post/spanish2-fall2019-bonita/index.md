## Vocabulary

In Spanish we have more than one way to point out that something/someone is attractive. Here are just a few.

| **Spanish**     | **English** | **Comment**                                                    |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| bonita/bonito   | pretty    |                                                            |
| linda/lindo     | pretty    |                                                            |
| linda/lindo     | cute      | In some countries, people use "mono" but it is not common. |
| hermosa/hermoso | beautiful |                                                            |

## Books

Remember you can use any resource from the library. However, if you are willing to invest in a book, I personally recommend this workbook.
