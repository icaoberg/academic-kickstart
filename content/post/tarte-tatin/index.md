So I spent a few hours looking for quick lunches for work. The goals

* Eat better quality food. Having control of all ingredients that go into my food is essential for keeping my health as optimal as possible.
* Save money. The excuse that fast food is cheaper is no longer the case. Every day it has become more affordable to cook at home. Even if I were to prepare fast food at home, it would still be more affordable to do so at home.

I have quiches in the past which I enjoy very much. But I want to find a recipe that uses more fresh veggies and less animal protein. Alas, tarte Tatin (or any Franken-tarte thereof).

On Pinterest and YouTube I found many alternatives for the dough. But to be honest, that isn't as important to me as the preparation of the vegetables. Today, I made a savory onion tarte Tatin. It was delicious. However I learnt a lot of useful things today

* Cut onions in the opposite direction, pole to pole. If you don't the onions will become mushy by the time these are caramilized.
* Less sugar is better. I added half of the sugar recommended by most recipes and it was still sweet.
* Add fresh herbs to caramelized onions once these are fully cooked.
* Cooking the tarte when the veggies are cold is better.

I enjoyed it but it may have been too sweet for Barbs. I think one of the things I am trying next

* Beet+onion tarte Tatin. I love beets.
* I could make the traditional caramelized onion version but I think I could add shredded carrots, zucchini and squash. I have to try.
* If the mixture is too liquid, I think I could add some potato/tapioca starch to make it thicker when cold. This is a little trick I also use when making empanadas.
