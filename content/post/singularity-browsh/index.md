Here is the deal, I have been using [Lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/) since forever. Just because. However today I found about [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/). What a joyous moment!

Finally a browser I would feel happy running on the HPC cluster. As always, I think Singularity is the best way to deploy tools like this for larger machines (especially if you are a user without root privileges).

Enjoy!
