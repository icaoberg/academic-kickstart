I was watching this video today

{{< youtube bzTcXl-IGPQ >}}

and it meantioned a service called [Olio](http://www.olio.com). Olio " connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, not thrown away. This could be food nearing its sell-by date in local stores, spare home-grown vegetables, bread from your baker, or the groceries in your fridge when you go away. For your convenience, OLIO can also be used for non-food household items too."

I think is amazing. I wished we had something similar in the U.S.A. Unfortunately it only works in United Kingdom and Spain. Oh well, it is what it is.

P.S. Thesea are the kind of resources I like to see happening. Technology can be used to improve our lives positively.
