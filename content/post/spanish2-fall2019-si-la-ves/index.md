## Exercises

All comments below are based as my experience as an interpreter and are not set in stone. These are based on what was discussed in the experience today.

### Interpretation

Franco de Vita and Ricardo Montaner are well known interpreters. Their music are generally slow paced so these are great songs to practice your Spanish with

* [Franco de Vita - Te Amo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGFUUsZOvNs)
* [Franco de Vita - Tú de que Vas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hRlvcy3V9k)
* [Ricardo Montaner - Tan Enamorados](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwPz_uPahMM)

### Translation

We attempted to translate

"I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance/The second I do, I know we're gonna be through/I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you/He don't suspect a thing. I wish he'd get a clue"

Our best guess was

"Yo no le voy a enseñar a bailar, bailar, bailar, bailar/En el momento que lo hago, yo sé que lo nuestro se acabará/Yo no le voy a enseñar a bailar contigo/El no sospecha nada. Me gustaría que se diera cuenta"
