## Vocabulary

This Saturday we had a brief discussion about different words we use to express when someone is expecting or is about to give birth. See the table below.

| Spanish    | English       | Comment                    |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| avergonzada/o | embarassed | | 
| embarazada | pregnant      |                            |
| encinta    | pregnant      |                            |
| preñada    | pregnant      | Generally used for animals |
| dar a luz  | childbirth delivery |                            |
| parir      | to give birth | Generally used for animals |
| parto   | labor |                            |

*Comment*: I updated two entries from the table above to reflect the suggestions from a bilingual OBGYN.

* Using the word *preñada* and/or the verb *parir* is usually meant for animals or as an insult.
* It may be fine to use those words between expecting mothers or friends. However, avoid using them to be safe.
* In some countries and in some socio-economic classes it is acceptable as well. Again, avoid using them to be safe.
* Found this interesting [article](http://xn--portal-espaol-skb.es/Alumnos.php?id=3&type=1&number=76&lang=esp&ll=esp) about this topic.
