It’s time for WRCT’s annual [Anatomy of the Ear](http://www.wrct.org/2019/11/02/anatomy-of-the-ear-nov-8-10/)!

Starting Friday, November 8, our DJs will be collaborating live on air to take you on a journey through the genres WRCT staff enjoy the most. That weekend, afternoons and evenings will be filled with hour-long blocks of your favorite genres — and ones that may be new to you! (You have a collection of Detroit Scam Rap artists, right?)

Watch this space for the schedule — coming soon!

Then expand your mind by tuning in to 88.3 FM, Pittsburgh, or catching the shows at this very website!
