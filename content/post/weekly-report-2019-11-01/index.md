Overall, today was a productive day. I spent the day automating certain tasks in order to be more productive in the future. The possibility to provide results quickly is important in my line of work. Some of this scripts need to be rebuilt because have been updated.

Even though some people would argue these scripts are relatively simple, I enjoy it very much.
