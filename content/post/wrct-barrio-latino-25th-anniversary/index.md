DID YOU KNOW THAT BARRIO LATINO IS THE OLDEST LATINO, SPANISH-LANGUAGE, LATINO RADIO PROGRAM IN PITTSBURGH?

BARRIO HAS BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK SINCE 1995, starting as Revista Radial Latinoamericana, and taking the name Barrio Latino in 2008! Thanks to Martha Mantilla! So, when we say "Barrio Latino is the only neighborhood in Pittsburgh where only Spanish is spoken," we mean it! We go way back! 25 years!

P.S. Wow! 25 years. That's a long time.
