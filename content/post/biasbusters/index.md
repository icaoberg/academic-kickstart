Today I attended [BiasBusters](https://scs4all.cs.cmu.edu/biasbusters/). "BiasBusters@CMU is modeled on Googleâ€™s Bias Busting@ Work program, and developed in concert with Google. The program was piloted in the School of Computer Science (BiasBusters@SCS,CMU) to engage over issues of bias, diversity, and inclusion. BiasBusters sessions are led by members of the CMU community who have volunteered to be trained as program facilitators. BiasBusters@CMU now reaches communities across the Carnegie Mellon campus."

Even though I am an underrepresented minority in STEM, that does not imply that I am aware of every situation every member of this group has experienced. It was enlightening to listen to the experience(s) of other members of this group and how this/these impacted them.
