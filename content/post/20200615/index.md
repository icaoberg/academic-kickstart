It has been two weeks since I joined the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Even though it is overwhelming at times, I really enjoy the new projects, as well as my new peers and colleagues.

Can't wait to work on this year's [MMBioS 2020 - Cell Modeling Workshop](https://mmbios.pitt.edu/cmw2017/agenda?id=231) from the other side of the aisle. This is going to be an awesome experience. I haven't helped organize a workshop since the symposiums back in Puerto Rico.
