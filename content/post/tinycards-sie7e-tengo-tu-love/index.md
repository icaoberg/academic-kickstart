This flashcards set was created for the attendees of the [Pittsburgh Spanish Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Spanish/events/264262917/) and the [Spanish II](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/?s=spanish+ii&search-location=Website) experience at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

P.S. This is one of my favorite songs. Kind in Spanglish and many references to American pop culture.
