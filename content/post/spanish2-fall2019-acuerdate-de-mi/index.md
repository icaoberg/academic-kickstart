## Exercises

All comments below are based as my experience as an interpreter and are not set in stone. These are based on what was discussed in the experience today.

### Vocabulary

In the song *Materialista*, Silvestre and Nicky Jam use the word **rumba**. Rumba is a kind of dance, but we also use it as a synonym for *party*/*partying*.

### Translation

* “I threw a wish in the well/Don't ask me I'll never tell/I looked at you as it fell/And now you're in my way” -Carly Rae Jepsen ([Call Me Maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic))

The translation we agreed on was

* "Yo tiré un deseo en el pozo/no me preguntes, nunca lo diré/Te miré mientras caía/y ahora estás en mi camino" -Carly Raw Jepsen (Call Me Maybe)

### Interpretation

{{< youtube YG2p6XBuSKA >}}


The interpretation exercise today was based on the song *El Amante* by Nicky Jam. Music video above. The snippet we tried to interpret was

"Esta la hice pa' él/Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver/Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted/Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce/Todo es por usted"

-Nicky Jam (El Amante)
