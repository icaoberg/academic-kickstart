For this example I am using the image generated by CellOrganizer’s demo2D00.

```
>> help demo2D00
 demo2D00
 
 Synthesize one 2D image from all object models. Results will be one TIFF file, with six slices, one each for cell boundary, nuclear boundary, nucleoli, mitochondria, lysosomes, and endosomes.
```

which generate one multitiff file

```
>> setup;
demo2D00()

The generated image is

```
>> img = tif2img( 'demo2D001.tif' );
>> whos img
  Name        Size                  Bytes  Class     Attributes
  img       778x758x6            28306752  double
>> imshow( reshape( img, size(img,1),[] ) )
```

## Intro to Bio-Formats

The important thing to keep in mind is that the pixel data in an OMERO image is essentially a 5D array, where the information is stored as xyzct.

Since we are not saving any metadata in the OME.tiff, we can save the pixel data in three steps

* Read the original synthetic image generated from CellOrganizer
* Reshape the pixel data to a 5D array
* Save the pixel data using BioFormats

### Reading and saving the data as an OME.tiff

```
img = tif2img( 'demo2D001.tif' );
addpath( './bfmatlab' );
omeimg = [];
for i=1:1:size(img,3)
    %remember the indices mean xyzct
    omeimg(:,:,1,i,1) = img(:,:,i);
end
bfsave( omeimg, 'demo2D001.ome.tif' );
```

The above snippet generates a valid OME.tiff. You can then use OMERO.importer to import the image to the server

Once the image has been imported, you should be able to use OMERO.insight to see it

You can double click on the image thumbnail to open the full viewer

Notice the six colored buttons to the right. Those represent the different channels. At the bottom of the screen you can also notice the string “Z=1/1, T=1/1”. This means we successfully made and imported a single time point 2D image with 6 channels.
