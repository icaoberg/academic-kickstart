I have many things to do today. Even though I appreciated the silence the first few days working from home, now the silence is deafening. However, I shouldn't complain. I am lucky to be able to work while so many cannot afford to do the same.

Today I will work on

* writing docs (this task never stops, ever).
* writing recipes for Singularity containers. Especifically R.
* prepare a tutorial on how to build your own Singularity images from your own recipes in our cluster.
* code for CellOrganizer.

What a long day. It is, what it is.
