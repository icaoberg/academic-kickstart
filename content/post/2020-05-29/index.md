Today is my last day as a member of the [Murphy Lab](http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu) and as research staff of the [Computational Biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu) at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.scs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu). 

Starting June 1, 2020 I will be joining the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](http://www.psc.edu) as a [Research Software Specialist](http://psc.edu/staff/cao-berg).

It has been a pleasure working with peers, colleagues and friends for the last ten years. But every journey must come to an end.

You can still reach me thru my [Andrew e-mail](mailto:icaoberg@andrew.cmu.edu) and [Andrew site](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~icaoberg).
